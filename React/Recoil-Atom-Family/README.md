# AtomFamily
- used to get specific items from list of items then instead creating multiple atoms we use atom Family
- AtomFamily returns a functions which returns a new Atom
- means used for dynamically creating Atoms
- if we use same id which with we already created Atom, & another component is calling atom family with same id then it won't create new atom it retuns previously created atom
